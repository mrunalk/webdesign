    <h1>Electric Vehicle</h1>
    <hr>
    <p>An electric vehicle, also called an electric drive vehicle, uses one or more electric motors or traction motors for propulsion. <br> An electric vehicle may be powered through a collector system by&nbsp;electricity from off-vehicle sources, or may be self-contained with a battery, solar panels or an electric generator to convert fuel to electricity.[1] EVs include road and rail vehicles, surface and underwater vessels, electric aircraft and electric spacecraft.</p>
